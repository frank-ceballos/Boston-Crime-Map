# Boston Crime Map
 
In this notebook, we will demonstrate the capabilites of Python to create web-based maps from geospatial data. We will be using Follium which is built upon Leaflet a JavaScript library for building interactive maps. What this means is that, we can manipulate and visualize geospatial data without leaving the Python ecosystem.

Github might not render correctly the Jupyter notebook so you can click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/frank-ceballos/Boston-Crime-Map/blob/master/Boston%20Crime%20Map.ipynb) to see it in action. 

Note: It seems that the notebook renders completely with Firefox but not with Google Chrome.
